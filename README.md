# solvable-maze
Creates fully connected solvable mazes and solves them with dead end canceling strategy. 
Maze space is optimized so that all paths are connected to each other and both path and wall width is a constant 1 pixel.
Script is able to create mazes with desired size of x*y relatively fast. (500*500 px takes ~1s)
